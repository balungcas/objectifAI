# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Additional Documentation

For more detailed information on the object detection concepts and a reference Python implementation, see the following files in the `docs` folder:

- [`docs/object-detection-detailed-guide.md`](docs/object-detection-detailed-guide.md): An in-depth guide to object detection principles, setup, and concepts, originally provided alongside the reference Python notebook.
- [`docs/reference-object-detection-notebook.py`](docs/reference-object-detection-notebook.py): A Python notebook (exported as a .py file) demonstrating an object detection pipeline using TensorFlow. This is provided for reference and to understand the underlying mechanisms that inspire the object detection features in this application. It is not directly run by this Next.js application.

These documents can provide valuable context for the object detection capabilities being built into this application.
